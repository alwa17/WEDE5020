NPO business. Music To the World

The business idea I have in mind is a place where children and teenagers can interact and learn new things to keep them off of the street, things such as learning to play different instruments and being part of a musical group choir . All of this can take place at a local community hall, with guidance from members of the organization and volunteering parents of the children.

This movement is driven from the rising crime rated and drug use in local communities and this NPO believes that this will serve as one of the solutions to all these problems that we are facing in our country. Everything done by this organization will be free off charge and opening the new opportunities to everyone who is intereseted to be part of it.

The website of the organization will also have all the necessary details needed by parents and guardians such as the following,
